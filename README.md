# genshinSlots
This is a script from a slot machine game that I am making with an art team and website owner. I only could include a small part of the whole project but this is one of the main scripts that determines points and displays some data. This project has given me a good amount of experience working with 2D arrays and data structures and how to iterate on them efficiently using different kinds of loops. It has also given me a huge appreciation for breaking things up into smaller scripts and truly understand why we should make good use of functions. Overall I have probably gained the most knowlege from this project from both the scope of the project and the amount of time it has taken me to work out all of the design details. Requirements elicitation and a proper planning stage was necissary for this project but I did not learn the basics of these things until a semester after I started working on this project. Some of the problems I have run into during the process led me to grow a ton as a developer and retain why we should do proper planning instead of just coding.
